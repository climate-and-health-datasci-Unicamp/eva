Extreme Value Analysis

This project aims to present an approach of extreme value theory in analyses of the temperature in Campinas.
The first part is in python, the second one in R.
Data the data used is from IAC, only the daily maximum temperature. There is a brief analysis with the whole dataset (1956-2018) but was mostly used the years (2000-2016)
In extreme value analyses (EVA) was used week intervals, so the idea is to seek a distribution that models the week maximum.

Also, for comparison, there is a file with an LSTM model to predict temperature max daily. it was used the same dataset but included the daily minimum.
